# 42-Piscine
Repository to hold my work while at the C Piscine @ 42 Silicon Valley

The 42 Silicon Valley C Piscine is a 30-day long trial period to potentially gain access to the completely free, decentralized
Computer Science school "42" (in Silicon Valley).

The C Piscine's goal is to give students a basic foundation of C Programming and basic Computer Science theories.
